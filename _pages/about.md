Hello there, thanks for stopping by my website ðŸ‘‹

I am Tirthankar, a BS-MS Physics student at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (class of 2028).

I am currently a remote research intern at the Fields Institute of Mathematical Sciences, where I am exploring the realm of surrogate models for hydrodynamical systems under self gravity using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

I am mainly interested in the intersection of computational astrophysics ðŸŒŒ and scientific machine learning ðŸ¤–.

Large scale structures of the Universe and galaxies excite me a lot. Apart from that exoplanets are also something I recently got interested in.

Apart from these, I am also a huge fan of anime; and also really like the piano ðŸŽ¹. 

Please have a look at my projects page as well. For more info you can also check out my CV.

Thanks for the visit âœ¨.
